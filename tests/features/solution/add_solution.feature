Feature: "Add solution" visibility options.
  In order to manage solutions
  As a moderator
  I need to be able to add "Solution" rdf entities through UI.

  Scenario: "Add solution" button should only be shown to moderators and facilitators.
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Collection solution test |
      | logo  | logo.png                 |
      | state | validated                |

    When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Collection solution test" collection
    And I go to the homepage of the "Collection solution test" collection
    Then I should see the link "Add solution"

    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage of the "Collection solution test" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add solution"

    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage of the "Collection solution test" collection
    Then I should not see the link "Add solution"

  Scenario: "Propose solution" button should be shown to everyone.
    Given the following collection:
      | title | Collection propose solution test |
      | logo  | logo.png                         |
      | state | validated                        |

    When I am an anonymous user
    And I go to the homepage
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
    When I go to the homepage of the "Collection propose solution test" collection
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
    When I click "Propose solution"
    # Anonymous users are prompted to login.
    Then I should see the error message "Access denied. You must log in to view this page."

    When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
    And I go to the homepage
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
    When I go to the homepage of the "Collection propose solution test" collection
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
    When I click "Propose solution"
    # Authenticated users can propose solutions.

    When I am logged in as a user with the "moderator" role
    And I go to the homepage
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
    When I go to the homepage of the "Collection propose solution test" collection
    Then I should see the link "Propose solution"
