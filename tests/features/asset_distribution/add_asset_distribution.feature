Feature: Add distribution through the UI
  In order to manage distributions
  As a moderator
  I need to be able to add "Distribution" RDF entities through the UI.

  Background:
    Given the following solution:
      | title       | Solution random x name           |
      | description | Some reusable random description |
      | state       | validated                        |
    And the following collection:
      | title      | Asset Distribution Test |
      | logo       | logo.png                |
      | affiliates | Solution random x name  |
      | state      | validated               |
    And the following release:
      | title         | Asset release random name        |
      | description   | Some reusable random description |
      | is version of | Solution random x name           |

    Scenario: "Add distribution" button should not be shown to unprivileged users.
      When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Solution random x name" solution
      And I go to the homepage of the "Asset release random name" release
      # Click the + button.
      Then I click "Add"
      Then I should see the link "Add distribution"

      When I am logged in as an "authenticated user"
      And I go to the homepage of the "Asset release random name" release
      Then I should not see the link "Add distribution"

      When I am an anonymous user
      And I go to the homepage of the "Asset release random name" release
      Then I should not see the link "Add distribution"

    Scenario: Add distribution as a facilitator.
      Given the following licence:
        | title       | WTFPL                                    |
        | description | The WTFPL is a rather permissive licence |
      When I am logged in as a "facilitator" of the "Solution random x name" solution
      When I go to the homepage of the "Asset release random name" release
      And I click "Add distribution"
      Then I should see the heading "Add Distribution"
      And the following fields should be present "Title, Description, License, Format, Representation technique, GITB compliant"
      # Field labels are implemented not consistently, so we are
      # forced to check for the widget heading.
      # @todo to be handled in ISAICP-2655
      And I should see the text "Access URL"
      And I should see the text "Distribution files"
      # @todo: The link has to be changed to the legal contact form.
      # @see: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/ISAICP-2789
      And I should see the link "contacting us"
      When I fill in "Title" with "Custom title of asset distribution"
      And I attach the file "test.zip" to "Distribution file"
      And I select "WTFPL" from "License"
      And I fill in "Representation technique" with "Web Ontology Language Full/DL/Lite"
      And I press "Save"
      Then I should have 1 distribution

      # Debug step since the default view of the distribution, does not have the access URL shown.
      And the "Custom title of asset distribution" distribution should have the link of the "test.zip" in the access URL field

      # Check if the asset distribution is accessible as an anonymous user
      When I go to the homepage of the "Asset release random name" release
      Then I should see the text "Distribution"
      And I should see the link "Custom title of asset distribution"
      When I click "Custom title of asset distribution"
      Then I should see the heading "Custom title of asset distribution"
      And I should see the link "WTFPL"

      # The licence label should be shown also in the solution UI.
      When I go to the homepage of the "Solution random x name" solution
      Then I should see the text "WTFPL"
      # Clean up the asset distribution that was created through the UI.
      Then I delete the "Custom title of asset distribution" asset distribution
